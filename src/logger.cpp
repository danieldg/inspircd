#include "inspircd.h"

/*
 * Suggested implementation...
 *	class LogManager
 *		bool AddLogType(const std::string &type, enum loglevel, LogStream *)
 *		bool DelLogType(const std::string &type, LogStream *)
 *		Log(const std::string &type, enum loglevel, const std::string &msg)
 *		std::map<std::string, std::vector<LogStream *> > logstreams (holds a 'chain' of logstreams for each type that are all notified when a log happens)
 *
 *  class LogStream
 *		std::string type
 *      virtual void OnLog(enum loglevel, const std::string &msg)
 *
 * How it works:
 *  Modules create their own logstream types (core will create one for 'file logging' for example) and create instances of these logstream types
 *  and register interest in a certain logtype. Globbing is not here, with the exception of * - for all events.. loglevel is used to drop 
 *  events that are of no interest to a logstream.
 *
 *  When Log is called, the vector of logstreams for that type is iterated (along with the special vector for "*"), and all registered logstreams
 *  are called back ("OnLog" or whatever) to do whatever they like with the message. In the case of the core, this will write to a file.
 *  In the case of the module I plan to write (m_logtochannel or something), it will log to the channel(s) for that logstream, etc.
 *
 * NOTE: Somehow we have to let LogManager manage the non-blocking file streams and provide an interface to share them with various LogStreams,
 *       as, for example, a user may want to let 'KILL' and 'XLINE' snotices go to /home/ircd/inspircd/logs/operactions.log, or whatever. How
 *       can we accomplish this easily? I guess with a map of pre-loved logpaths, and a pointer of FILE *..
